== Changesets ==

Changesets is a Ruby on Rails application to keep track of your changesets/commits in a version controlled software project. It is intended for a workflow where commits are being made to a development branch and need to be merged into a staging or production branch on a per-commit basis. Changesets allows you to keep track of each commit you make including its revision number of SHA, an optional ticket number if the commit references a ticket in issue tracking system, a commit message/description, and arbitrary notes. Most importantly, Changesets allows you to toggle the status of each changeset between "merged" and "unmerged" to keep track of which of your changesets still needs to be merged into your staging/production branch.

== Setup ==

1) Set up URLs in config/app_config.yml. An explanation is provided inside the file.
2) Run rake gems:install to install gem dependencies.
3) Run rake db:setup to create the database and load the schema.

That's all it should require. Just start up the server and get going!
